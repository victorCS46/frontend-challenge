# Start the project in your system
Here you got a documentation about how to run the repository's project in your system

## You need to install
 - [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/)
 
 If you have installed these before then let's go with the first step

##  Step 1. Clone or download the repository:

 - (If you haven't installed ```git``` yet. Don't worry you can download the repository in this **[Link]**)(https://github.com/victorCS46/frontend-challenge/archive/master.zip). 

 - Open the terminal and go to the directory where you want to store the repository
   then execute this command:
   
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:victorCS46/frontend-challenge.git
   ```
  
 - If you want name the dir with a name that you want execute this:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:victorCS46/frontend-challenge.git <dir name>
    ```

## Step 2. Run the project:

 - In terminal. Go to the directory where you have the repository and then execute this command:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all the node modules that we need to run the project

 - Now to start running the project we'll execute this last command 
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   After execute this command, you will see how your browser open a new window (or a tab if you have your browser running)
   with the URL **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

## That's all folks ;)
